### **Module I: Bacteria**

#### **Unit 1: Bacteria**

1. **Cell Structure and Classification of Bacteria**:
   - **Structure**:
     - **Cell Wall**: Maintains shape and protects the cell; Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer, while Gram-negative bacteria have a thin layer with an outer membrane.
     - **Plasma Membrane**: Semi-permeable, controls substance movement.
     - **Cytoplasm**: Contains enzymes, nutrients, and ribosomes.
     - **Nucleoid**: Area where the bacterial DNA is located.
     - **Pili and Fimbriae**: Helps in adhesion to surfaces and conjugation.
     - **Flagella**: Tail-like structures for motility.
   - **Classification**:
     - **Shape**: Cocci (spherical), Bacilli (rod-shaped), Spirilla (spiral).
     - **Staining**: Gram-positive or Gram-negative based on cell wall differences.
     - **Respiration**: Aerobes, anaerobes, facultative anaerobes.
     - **Habitat**: Soil, water, living hosts.

2. **Staining Reactions**:
   - **Gram Staining**:
     - Process: Crystal violet stains the cells, iodine acts as a mordant, alcohol decolorizes, and safranin provides contrast.
     - Gram-positive retains violet, Gram-negative appears pink.
   - **Spore Staining**:
     - Highlights bacterial endospores (e.g., Bacillus and Clostridium species).
   - **Acid-Fast Staining**:
     - Used for Mycobacterium species like M. tuberculosis. Acid-fast bacteria retain carbol fuchsin dye even after acid-alcohol treatment.

3. **Bacterial Growth**:
   - **Nutritional Requirements**: Carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, vitamins, and minerals are essential for growth.
   - **Physical Factors**:
     - **Temperature**: Psychrophiles (cold), mesophiles (moderate), thermophiles (hot).
     - **pH**: Neutral pH is favorable for most bacteria.
     - **Oxygen**: Aerobes need oxygen, anaerobes do not.
   - **Culture Media**:
     - Nutrient media: General growth.
     - Selective media: Promote specific bacteria while inhibiting others.
     - Differential media: Differentiate based on colony appearance.
   - **Growth Curve**:
     - Lag Phase: No increase in numbers; adaptation period.
     - Log Phase: Rapid cell division.
     - Stationary Phase: Growth slows due to nutrient depletion.
     - Death Phase: Decline due to unfavorable conditions.

4. **Bactericidal Agents**:
   - **Phenol**: Disrupts cell membranes and denatures proteins.
   - **Alcohol**: Denatures proteins and dissolves lipids; effective against enveloped viruses and bacteria.

5. **Sterilization**:
   - **Principles**: Killing/removing all forms of microbial life.
   - **Methods**:
     - Physical: Heat (autoclaving, dry heat), filtration, UV light.
     - Chemical: Ethylene oxide gas, alcohols, aldehydes.

### **Module II: Viruses**

#### **Unit 3: Virus**

1. **Viral Morphology**:
   - **Capsid**: Protein coat surrounding the nucleic acid.
   - **Envelope**: Lipid layer in some viruses; contains glycoproteins.
   - **Genome**: DNA or RNA, single- or double-stranded.

2. **Viral Genome and Classification**:
   - Based on genome type: DNA viruses (Herpesviruses), RNA viruses (Influenza, HIV).
   - Based on replication strategies: Positive-sense RNA, negative-sense RNA.

3. **Viral Replication**:
   - **Attachment**: Virus binds to the host cell receptor.
   - **Penetration**: Entry into the host cell via endocytosis or fusion.
   - **Uncoating**: Release of viral genome.
   - **Replication**: Genome synthesis using host machinery.
   - **Assembly**: Formation of new virions.
   - **Release**: Virions exit the host cell (lysis or budding).
