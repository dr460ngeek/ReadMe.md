### **Member 1: Introduction (~50 seconds)**  
“Good [morning/afternoon] everyone. Today, we are excited to present on the topic *‘Smart Cities According to Indian Needs.’*  

So, what is a smart city? It’s an urban area that integrates advanced technologies to improve the quality of life, optimize resource use, and ensure sustainable development.  

But why are smart cities so important for India? By 2030, nearly 40% of our population will live in urban areas, creating immense pressure on infrastructure, transportation, water supply, and waste management. The Government of India launched the *Smart Cities Mission* in 2015 to address these challenges.  

In this presentation, we’ll discuss the key features, benefits, challenges, success stories, and future vision of smart cities in India.”
